_Picogen_ is/will be a rendering system for the creation and rendering of artificial nature, primarily based on ray tracing.

While the primary purpose of picogen is to display realistic 3d terrain, both in terms of terrain formation and image plausability, it also is a heightmap-creation tool (the underlying basis is a turing complete programming language created just for picogen, but users will get a friendly point/click/drag/drop interface, so no programming skills are mandatory).
